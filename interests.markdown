When I started studying astronomy I didn't really know what I wanted. I love it, but I want to pursue other things in life that will generate a more tangible improvement in our society as well. For this reason, I'm getting into social sciences as well. In my formation as a scientist I've learned different ways of thinking, and to work hard as well, since this area is full of challenges. My studies on social sciences are presenting me other ways of thinking, and this has been very appealing.

These ways of thinking are, in my opinion, complementary in both directions. Data driven processes of thought and logic allow us to test our hypothesis, but in order to generate those hypothesis, our mids usually take a different approach, more based on imitation, extrapolation and combination of external ideas, discussions with peers, and why not recognize it: normative ideas and other biases that might come from morality or aesthetics. More recently I've gained consciousness of the way this hypotheses originate in our minds. Another human feature, the narrative way of thinking, has more to do with this than what I initially thought -Jordan Peterson's Podcast has a very interesting episode about this that I link below-.

## On Natural Sciences

Due to my academic formation, most of this interests of mine, are in physics and astrophysics. More so, computational astrophysics and data analytics are what I mostly work in, but of course, in the process I have to know about the theory behind what I'm investigating.

### Minor planets: ABCs.

A few years ago I was recruited by Prof. Ignacio Ferrin at Universidad de Antioquia (UdeA) to help in an investigation on minor planets. The hypothesis that motivated this line of work was that the solar system is populated with lots of active asteroids, which are not merely fluffly rocks in our vecinity, but also a potential recipient of lots of water.

### Galactic dynamics

I'm currently researching in galactic dynamics as part of my thesis investigation to obtain the title of astronomer.

When I was deciding what undergraduate programm to choose, a decisive factor was an interest for cosmology. This was motivated by some pop-sci books I read in the year of that decision. Galactic dynamics opens a window to that research field for me, and from the researchers at my institution, this was one of the closests branches, so this was a big motivation to select this line of investigation. Another motivation is that I like the methodology of this field, because I can do data analytics (i.e. in GAIA's data), and computational simulations, which I have studied previously in my carreer (i.e. N-body and SPH algorithms).

### Other interests on NS

#### Quantum mechanics and quantum computing

I'm currently taking a graduate-level course on quantum mechanics at Universidad de Antioquia. The spanish version of the curriculum is accesible [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/15kUm1ybglLofhhctXRQGXRDXE0-Uqtl1/view?usp=sharing).

I'm interested in quatum computing, but I wont start studying that until at least I finish the previously mentioned course in QM.

## On Social Sciences

Motivated on the possibility of learning different ways of thinking, I'm challenging me to "independently" educate myself on social sciences. For a long period of time there has been the belief that there couldn't be intellectuals that mastered all the areas of human knowledge. I think that possibility is opening up again, with the potential of technology extending cognitive and cognoscitive capabilities of the human mind.

With that in mind, while I'm young I want to developt as many different ways of thinking as I can, enabling me to cultivate myself for the rest of my life, which is one of the purposes is guiding me through my search of a purpose in life.

Other important factor is the free knowledge. I myself am not wealthy enough to access as much of the material I would like to pay for. Fortunately, there are multiple online resources that can guide a self-education program. Altough we have made a lot of advances on free knowledge, there is still improvements that could be done in, for example, accreditation for autodidactic people, which is in my opinion one of the most effective ways one could combat inequality.

Between this offers of free knowledge, in this part of my formation I'll follow the [MIT OpenCourseWare](https://ocw.mit.edu/index.htm) options on this matter.

### Economics

I'm designing a learning plan to learn economcis on my own. I'm mainly guiding myself with the curriculum of the Major programms on Economics that MIT offers. From there, I'll follow the course plans for the different subjects of my interest at [ocw.mit.org](https://ocw.mit.edu/index.htm).

#### Microeconomics

The Microeconomcis course I'm following is publicly available at [Principles of Microeconomics at MIT](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/economics/14-01sc-principles-of-microeconomics-fall-2011/index.htm).
