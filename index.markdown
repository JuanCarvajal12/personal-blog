Hi! welcome to my blog, I'm Carva! I'm an astronomy student at Universidad de Antioquia, Colombia. I'm in my last year at the Uni, learning about varied things and working on different projects.

In this blog I'll update about my current lines of work and study, and share the ideas that I think are worth reading (or worth writing for myself!).

At the moment, the most important thing I'm doing is deciding what to do with my life. I've been feeling too disperse; interested in too many things that don't align with a single objective, and this has been troubling. For that reason, my main concern at the moment is deciding what objective is going to guide my life, and what philosophy am I going to follow for this purpose.
