Today, on Dec 21, 2021, I started building this personal website. Here, I'll start publicly sharing ideas about my work, and my interests.

At this moment, I'm a 22 yo astronomy student at Universidad de Antioquia, Colombia (soon to be an astronomer in 2022). I have a wide range of interests, but to be brief, I love learning stuff, to the point I would dedicate my life to doing so.

On Natural Sciences, I'm passionate about physics and astrophysics; I enjoy programming and am interested in technology. I, recently, also started learning about Social Sciences (economy in particular).

I'm a supporter of open-source and open knowledge. I believe the future of the humanity is bright. I'm still figuring out the philosophy I'll live under and the objective of my life.
